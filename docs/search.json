    "text": "Hello! My name is Ajinkya Ranade. I currently work as JSPS postdoctoral fellow at Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan. My research focuses on innovating efficient, sustainable and fit-for-purpose water treatment technologies for water recycling and energy conservation.\nAn analytical chemist with interdisciplinary research experience in graphene technology, optoelectronics, and wastewater treatment exploring opportunities to innovate sustainable treatment technologies in the research and development sector. I aim to utilize my interdisciplinary background for innovation in clean energy and tackling the water-energy nexus to achieve a sustainable future. Currently looking for organizations that provides me ample scope to nurture this interest and develop my skills.\n\nExpertise in individual (adsorption, photocatalysis, biodegradation ) and synergic (intimately coupled photocatalytic biodegradation) wastewater treatment technologies with a critical focus on sustainability\nExpertise in materials engineering, graphene technology, semiconductor technology and optoelectronics\nExpertise in fabrication of high-quality monolayer graphene using (atmospheric and low pressure) chemical vapor deposition techniques\nPublished three first author publication and 9 co-author publications\nRecent publication in the prestigious Water Research Journal"
