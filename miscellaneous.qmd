After my final PhD thesis defence, I decided to explore Japan by working at a farmstay for a month in the coastal town of Itoshima, Fukuoka!

The surreal experience of working on the farm, eating fresh farm grown vegetables, long walks on the beach and trying surfing!

It was good to live life on 0.5x speed, in close contact with nature!
