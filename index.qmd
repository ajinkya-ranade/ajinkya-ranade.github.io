::: {style="text-align: justify"}
I am Ajinkya Ranade, currently working as JSPS postdoctoral fellow at [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english){target="_blank"}, Japan. My research focusses on innovating efficient, sustainable and [**fit-for-purpose**]{.underline} water treatment technologies [**for water recycling and energy conservation.**]{.underline}

An analytical chemist with interdisciplinary research experience in graphene technology, semiconductor technology, optoelectronics, and wastewater treatment exploring opportunities to innovate **sustainable water treatment technologies** in the research and development sector. I aim to utilize my interdisciplinary knowledge to tackle **water-energy nexus and provide energy efficient and recyclable water treatment solutions** particularly for developing nations. Currently looking for organizations that provides me ample scope to nurture this interest and develop my skills.

-   Expertise in individual water treatment technologies (adsorption, photocatalysis, biodegradation ) and synergic water treatment technology (intimately coupled photocatalytic biodegradation) with a critical focus on sustainability and energy efficiency

-   Expertise in materials engineering, graphene technology, semiconductor technology and optoelectronics

-   Expertise in fabrication of high-quality monolayer graphene using (atmospheric and low pressure)\
    chemical vapor deposition techniques

-   Published three first author publication and 9 co-author publications

-   Recent publication in the prestigious **Water Research** Journal
